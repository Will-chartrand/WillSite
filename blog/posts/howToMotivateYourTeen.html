                        <br><br>
                        First of all, I'd like to point out that I'm 17 currently and struggle to find motivation
                        myself. I'm just here to give you, the parent, suggestions as to why your teen is not driven
                        to do anything, as well as tell you some things that you may not want to hear.
                        <br><br><br>

                        <h2>
                            1. Your teenager is not the problem.
                        </h2>
                        I know that I'm making a huge generalization hear, but let me explain further.
                        I can already tell by what you typed into the searchbar that you have the wrong perspective.
                        It is NOT your job to make your child do things for you. The motivation has to come from them,
                        as you may have had to learn the hard way. Breaking this mindset is very crucial to facilitate
                        the drive and motivation that your teen should have. Simply put, making your child do things
                        that
                        he/she/they do not want to do, and giving them responsibilities they are not willing to take
                        will not help.
                        It seems as though the root of this issue stems from their mental health. They first have to
                        have their other
                        needs met.

" alt="Maslow heirarchy of needs">
                        <br><br><br>
                        As you can see from this heirarchy of needs, finding creativity and drive is at the top. One of
                        the most sigificant things
                        on this chart that I'd like you to note is directly under the highest need. Ego.
                        <br>
                        If you are not giving your child respect, and the choice to take responsibility for things by
                        themself,
                        there is no chance that they will have any motivation to do anything.
                        To understand where I'm coming from, my Mother likes doing everything for me, and my Father
                        really wants me to
                        figure things out for myself and often makes me take up responsibilities that I don't care for.
                        Optimally, your parenting should sit
                        right in the middle of these two. You should allow your child to figure things out for
                        themselves, but at the same time
                        they need space and time to do their own thing.
                        <br>
                        If you give your teen too many responsibilities, they have no time to actually discover their
                        interests.
                        If you baby them, they won't learn anything, and you'll be left with someone who has no skills
                        of their own.
                        Find the middle ground.

                            2. Taking away priveleges is not a solution
                        </h2>

                        There are countless studies showing that rewarding good behaviour is infinitely more effective
                        than punishing bad behaviour.
                        If you already allow your child to drink alcohol before the legal drinking age, play on their
                        phone into ungodly hours of the night,
                        and not show you the respect that you think you deserve, it's already too late. You cannot take
                        away these things unless you're willing
                        to lose all the respect you had from your teen. Just do not give them any more priveleges unless
                        they earn it.
                        Instead, You can reward the good. You should let your child know that you appreciate them if
                        they do something notable,
                        like washing the dishes themselves, or even showing you how to do something on your computer
                        when you ask.
                        The truth is, your teen probably wants to respect you, but you may be making that difficult for
                        them to do.
                        Going back to my previous point, your child needs to have everything sorted in the heirarchy of
                        needs before they actually
                        feel motivated to do things on their own. This means showing your teen respect, appreciation,
                        and give them a sense of connection.
                        They want to feel included, so make that easy for them to acquire.
                        <br>
                        Something I should point out is that you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make them
                        drink it.
                        If they have everything they need it may still take time for them to get motivation, and you
                        can't force that on them.
                        When your child displays that they feel appreciated and respected (whether through being in a
                        better mood or taking up
                        more responsibilities willfully), you know that you're doing the best job possible. This is all
                        that you should be
                        aiming for as a parent.

                            3. There needs to be some sort of order in the house
                        </h2>

                        Listen, I don't know what kind of situation you're in. And I'm just a kid myself, why should my
                        words have any bearing
                        on your life anyway? But I can tell you right now: If you and your significant other yell at
                        eachother and have a sporadic schedule,
                        your teen will not react well to this. There needs to be something that they can expect every
                        day, Whether that be dinner at the
                        same time or even just a quiet afternoon to come home to, your teen needs to feel like they have
                        some sort of expectation
                        that they can expect a safe, unchanging(just not sporadic) environment that awaits them.
                        <br>
                        If you already have this sort of environment,
                        you can now focus on what your child actually wants out of life. Being in a pandemic and
                        whatnot,
                        right now is the perfect time to get involved with what your child is interested in, and how you
                        can support them.
                        I cannot stress how crucial it is for you to actually care about what your child needs.
